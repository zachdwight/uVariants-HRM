# uVariants

Web application for automated annotation and design of amplicons (biotech, molecular diagnostics).  

Current State: 
March 26 2025 - the app is back in service with a todos....

>> Update genome from hg38 to hs1 (https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hs1/bigZips/)
>> 
>> Fix Gene annotation on SNP query (kick out to GUI)
>> 
>> Recalculate 6mers (3' check utility)

The application relies on a 2bit file representation of the genome - much like UCSC's Genome Browser solutions.  Python is used on the backend to retrieve contextual sequences for SNPs queried, providing good performance.  I will be adding the entire 2bit genome backend soon on GitHub (after some cleanup now that quite a bit was updated).
