# uVariants

Web application for automated annotation and design of amplicons (biotech, molecular diagnostics).

Original site now under construction for rebuild: https://dna-utah.org/variants/

Check out the poster here!  https://dna-utah.org/Posters/2017_AMP_Poster_Zach.pdf

Note: As of March 26 2025 - the app is back in service with a few bugs.

For questions, reach out to zach@dna-utah.org.  I will be adding the entire 2bit genome backend soon on GitHub.
